# Scrutiny
    
## Uncover edge cases by bringing Property-Based Tests to the UI

---

# Agenda

1. UI Testing is terrible 
2. Property-based tests
3. User's journey
4. How to better

---

# UI Testing is terrible 
    
* Tedious to write tests
* Flaky runs
* "Test Modeling"
    
???
    Actually writing tests is incredibly tedious. Difficult to use the correct methods for finding the wanted DOM elements
    
    Test runs suffer from "flakiness", but this is more to do with the actual tests themselves, 
        not an inherent property of UI tests
    
    Database is one giant state
    
    Scrutiny won't help with any of these

---
   
# Writing tests is tedious
    
* Lot's of duplicated selectors
* Many actions need to be repeated
* The only path that is tested is what the developer thinks of
    
???
    Show code examples of the basic tests:
    
    * Can sign up
    * Can publish new article
    * Can favorite an article
    
    Mention that similar problems exist with "normal" unit/integration tests. It just happens to be less of a problem because things move much faster
    
---
    
# Property based tests

* Automagically generates input values to your SUT
* Tests "properties" of your system
* Helps uncover edge cases that you didn't think of during development

# Example property test

Function to test
```fsharp
let rev list = 
    list |> List.rev;;
    
rev [1; 2; 3; 4];;
// [4; 3; 2; 1]
    
```
    
Property based test
```fsharp
// Uses FsCheck
[<Property>]
let testRev inputList =
    let property = inputList |> rev |> rev
    Assert.sequenceEquals inputList property
```
    
`inputList` is randomly generated for (default) 100 different lists

# User's journey

* How do you expect your user to use your UI
* Users are unpredictable
* Strange interactions occur

# Usual UI tests
    
User favorites an article

# Scrutiny UI Tests
    
User favorites an article and then writes a new article
